#Groovy and Scala Demo

Using Groovy, Gradle, Spock to test drive a Scala solution.

* using Gradle as build system.
* Spock and Groovy to drive with Data Driven Tests
* Scala to implement the solution using some nifty tricks.

##The Excercise: FizzBuzz

###Step 1

Write some code that prints out the following for a contiguous range of numbers:

* the number
* 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
* 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5
* 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output

1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

Archive this as a separate zip file then continue on to step two.

###Step 2
Enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:

* If the number contains a three you must output the text 'lucky'. This overrides any existing behaviour

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output

1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

Archive this as a separate zip file then continue on to step three
